## Help us build Threadbare

* Join our [forum](https://github.com/endlessm/threadbare/discussions) and give
  us [playtesting
  feedback](https://github.com/endlessm/threadbare/discussions/categories/playtest-feedback);
* Join [`#threadbare-development` on our Discord](https://discord.gg/mNtzvvaFXF)
  to discuss the project with the team in real-time.

Threadbare's code, comments, and development discussion are written in English.
If English is not your first language, don't worry: it's not the first language
for about half of the core team at Endless Access either, and we will be happy
to hear from you.

(We hope to add translations for the game itself in the medium term.)
